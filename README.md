This is Unit 4/5 of the Front-End Developer Career Path at Codecademy to practice Javascript and focus on building import and export expertise.

The import/ export modules were added to by me, along with edits to main.js, index.css, and index.html. 

A folder containing the module files (salaryData.js, workAroundModule.js, and utilities.js) are included but commented out and placed in main.js file since import/ export does not work in my browser.

Thank you for your support! Feel free to check in as I continue to build my developer skills.

Project Description from Codecademy-- 

WorkAround is a research organization that provides data on salary trends in the tech industry. Open up salaryData.js to see the data they have collected. Youâ€™ll notice that they have also created a few functions for filtering that data to get subsets of data by role and by company.

WorkAround now wants to release a new web application called WorkAround Explorer to make their data more easily viewable. This web app should allow users to choose specific roles and companies in the tech industry to see the following information:

The salary for the chosen role at the chosen company.
The industry average for the chosen role.
The average salary at the chosen company across all roles.
The industry average salary across all roles and all companies.
